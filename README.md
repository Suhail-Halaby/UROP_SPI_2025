Contains SHARPy instruction files, path planning strategies, and control system models intended for ICAV-SPI

This repository and the corresponding report presents the conceptual design, aeroelastic analysis, and mission planning of a high aspect ratio solar-powered UAV developed under Imperial Collegeâ€™s Solar Plane Initiative. The project aimed to establish a multidisciplinary framework for performance prediction and optimization, focusing on aeroelastic modeling using SHARPy, control law tuning via ArduPilot SITL, solar income estimation through shadow-casting simulations, and trajectory planning for endurance and point-to-point missions. The analysis confirmed structural stability across expected flight regimes and demonstrated effective integration of control and planning systems. The airframe construction nears completion, with flight testing anticipated in Autumn 2025.

The ICAV-SPI directory contains all of the relevant SHARPy files pertaining to the current iteration of the ICAV-SPI solar plane (Sept. 2025)
